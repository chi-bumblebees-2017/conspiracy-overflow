Have you ever had any questions about all of the conspiracy theories out there in the world? Have you ever felt overwhelmed by how many you have to have passing knowledge of just to get all the memes? We are designing a Stack Overflow-like website where you can ask questions and read answers to all the questions have for the people who believe in Flat Earth, lizard people, fake space travel, real time travel, ghouls, and more!
